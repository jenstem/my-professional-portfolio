## Description

As a current student, I wanted to create a website for use as a showcase of my work for potential employers.  I accomplished this by creating a website with the following sections; About Me (to tell the potential employer a little bit about who I am), My Portfolio (a place that shows and links to projects I've completed), Contact Me (A simple and easy way for potential employers to contact me directly).  I used HTML and CSS to build this website.

You can navigate the site by using the navigation links on the right side of the header.  Clicking on one of these, for example, "Contact Me", will bring you to the corresponding section on the page.  There are additional navigation links in the footer so the user doesn't have to scroll back up to get to these sections again.  Also included in the footer is a link to my Linked In profile.

## User Story

AS AN employer\
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples\
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work\
WHEN I load their portfolio\
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them\
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation\
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section\
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work\
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications\
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application\
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others\
WHEN I click on the images of the applications\
THEN I am taken to that deployed application\
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices\
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
